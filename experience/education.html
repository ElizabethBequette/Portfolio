			<h3>Education</h3>
			<p>I can credit a small margin of my knowledge of computers to my high school, Francis Howell
			Central, but a large portion of credit to them for my art and design knowledge. I have taken various computer classes and have always been the go-to person for helping
			instructors with their technical issues. During my first year of high school, I was enrolled in a class
			called Multimedia. In this class, I learned how to edit video and pictures, as well as editing audio and
			recording podcasts. I had already previously gone to camps over the summer for film editing, and I edit
			pictures in my freetime, so that also helped me succeed in that class. I took the second year of this my 
			sophomore year. My freshman and sophomore year were happily consumed by my Web Design class. I
			can credit my web design teacher for sparking my interest in software and developing websites. Though,
			due to the school set curriculum, my teacher wasn't able to teach our class much outside of the basics of HTML. So, 
			I took it upon myself to learn more outside of school. And then, thankfully, towards the end of
			sophomore year, I learned about tech school.</p>
			<p>A tech school like Lewis and Clark Career Center teach students about the importance of professionalism in the workplace
			along with the skill they enrolled themselves into. I have been heavily involved in my tech school during the last two years
			of high school. During these two years, I took 2 different classes at the Lewis and Clark
			Career Center. The first year I took Computer Maintence and Networking, and my senior year
			I enrolled in Computer Software Development. Both of these classes have aided tremendously
			in my knowledge of computers.Computer Maintence and Networking is a more hands-on class
			and it's meant to help advance you in the IT industry. Computer Software Development taught me
			about programming and the software side of things. Though I had previously taken 2 years of web design
			in high school, I learned much more at the college level than what I could've learned during any of
			my 4 years in high school.</p> 
			<h3>Work</h3>
			<p>Many people throughout high school hop from one job to another, never allowing themselves for a break to breathe
			inbetween. I have always been the type of person to focus heavily on one thing at once, whether it's school or work. So,
			during the early days of June my sophomore year of high school, I decided to get a job. Throughout the summer, I worked at McDonalds.
			I worked constantly, trying to gain as much experience that I could because I knew I was going to have to quit once school began.
			I learned how to handle customer service, multitask, and work under tremendous amounts of pressure. It also taught me valuable
			lessons about working with other people, especially in tense situations. I was dreading the fact that I had to leave work as the summer
			was coming to an end, and reluctantly I turned in my uniform at the end of July to begin my junior year.</p>
			<p>I have sense learned that I am capable of juggling the stress of school and the responsiblity of having a job and
			I am currently looking to get one. Though, I am struggling to get hired and I hope any employer will see that, though I have little work
			experience, the knowledge I have learned throughout tech and high school, and in the brief period I was working, will help their company succeed.
			I can provice customer service when needed and can help with technological issues. I can also work under pressure, work well with other, and I
			am considered a leader when in groups.</p>
